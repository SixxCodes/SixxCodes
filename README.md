## ðŸ“« Who am I?
Hi there! My name is Sixx!

Everything, tbh. I jump from one hobby to another! I have so much to do now and that is how I enjoy my life atm.
Specifically:
1. Crochet
2. Playing games (any genre and type of games)
3. Cross stitch
4. Journaling
5. Watching anime
6. etc.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning...
* Essential things I need to learn to be a software developer.
* how to make games on Godot. I want to make my first game, i'm not spoiling anything though, ehe.

## âš¡ Fun fact:

* I OPEN ISSUES ON GITHUB JUST SO I COULD RANT ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC REPOSITORY, I USE THEM LIKE DIARIES!
* I LIKE BREAD! I pair them with everything. Coffee, soup, pasta, tea, milk, cup noodles, and etc.

* My dream is to be a software engineer/developer in the future.

* I began with C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Later, I learned Java in my first year of school.
* In my second year, I started learning Python and SQL!
* Now, I'm still on my 2nd Year and I'm also learning GDscript and Dart and Flutter.
